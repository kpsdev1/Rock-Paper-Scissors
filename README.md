# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game which I built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a one page interactive site which takes in input from the user in the form of the user selecting their hand(rock, paper or scissors), then it displays their choice with a image of their chosen hand, at the same time it computes the computers hand and displays the corresponding image and then chooses the winner.

### Typography
The font that was used this game was **Allerta Stencil**.

### Color Scheme
The color scheme for this game was a light grey color for the background and the text is black, which really makes the text and images stand out. The users score dsiplays in green and the computers score displays in red which in this context would show the user that the green score is positive and red is negatative.
