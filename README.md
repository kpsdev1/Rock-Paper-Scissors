# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game which I built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a one page interactive site which takes in input from the user in the form of the user selecting their hand(rock, paper or scissors), then it displays their choice with a image of their chosen hand, at the same time it computes the computers hand and displays the corresponding image and then chooses the winner.
